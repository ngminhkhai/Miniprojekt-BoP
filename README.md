Code in Gd-skript and made with Godot 3.5

This Projekt was done in 3-4 weeks in a team of two. ItÂ´s the first Projekt I did in Godot, So I did a little bit of everthing. But I was mainly in charge of building the foundation (player movement, level creation, and Menus. I also did most of the graphics, ).
