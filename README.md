Code in Gd-skript and made with Godot 3.5

This Projekt was done in 3-4 weeks in a team of two. Since it was our first time programming with godot. I did a little bit of everthing. But I was mainly in charge of building the foundation (player movement, level creation). I also did most of the graphics on my own.
